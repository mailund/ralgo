Description: This package implements generic algorithms and data structures
    useful for algorithmic programming in R. The implementation of these is not
    the most efficient possible in R, since I have aimed at implementing them all
    in pure R and not exploit C or Rcpp, but they usually have better asymptotic
    performance than built in data strauctures.
