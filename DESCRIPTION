Description: This package implements generic algorithms and data structures useful for
    algorithmic programming in R. The implementation of these is not the most efficient possible
    in R, since I have aimed at implementing them all in pure R and not exploit C or Rcpp,
    but they are better than relying only on the built in data structures for some operations.
